## TO DO
- Use Respect or code some class to validate controller input
- Use translations to avoid string messages on code
- A better Exception Handler with customized Exceptions, to know which Exceptions I can show to user
- Improve JWT payload for security, like add IP
- Use DTO to avoid mistakes with array
- Use timestamp on "time" column. I decided to use string to simplify
- Unit and Integration Tests (I'm really sorry for not doing tests, I would like to and I know it. I do it everyday...)
- Use RabbitMQ to send e-mails asynchronously
