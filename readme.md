Make sure you have installed Docker Desktop. If you don't, follow the <a href="https://www.docker.com/get-started" target="_blank">Get Started with Docker</a>.


## Installation guide

#### Change the mailer settings on .env to a valid one
    MAILER_HOST=
    MAILER_PORT=

By default I left my data so it should work. But I advise you to change it.

**All done!** Everything should work wth a single command. The application will be available at
http://localhost/

## TO DO
- Use Respect or code some class to validate controller input
- Use translations to avoid string messages on code
- A better Exception Handler with customized Exceptions, to know which Exceptions I can show to user
- Improve JWT payload for security, like add IP
- Use DTO to avoid mistakes with array
- Use timestamp on "time" column. I decided to use string to simplify
- Unit and Integration Tests (I'm really sorry for not doing tests, I would like to and I know it. I do it everyday...)
- Use RabbitMQ to send e-mails asynchronously

## Notes
I've never worked with Slim before, so I read about it and made it as good as possible. Using Laravel as inspiration.
